We turned the ComfyUI image into a video using PixVerse AI, specifically leveraging its 'fly' feature to bring our AI-generated image of the legendary Orang Minyak to life. This innovative tool allowed us to create a smooth, cinematic motion effect, transforming the static image into a visually engaging video sequence that gives the impression of the mysterious figure gliding or flying through its environment. The result is a compelling blend of AI-generated art and dynamic animation, designed to evoke a sense of supernatural movement while maintaining the eerie, otherworldly atmosphere associated with the Orang Minyak folklore.


Some sample image that we generated is in our repository/samplefile
